# Engineering bootstrap (v0)

## Purpose
This bootstrap layer documents where future Engineering initialization will live once the system is ready to wire it in.

## Current behavior
Version 0 is intentionally non-executable. Nothing runs or is included from this directory today.

## Activation plan
When activation is introduced, it will be controlled by feature flags defined in `src/engineering/config/feature-flags.php`.
