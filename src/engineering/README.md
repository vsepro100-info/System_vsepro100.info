# Engineering layer (v0)

The Engineering layer defines how we introduce and manage code changes in a controlled, reversible way. It acts as the entry point for v0 work, describing why this layer exists and how it limits scope to reduce risk while the system evolves.

## v0 change rules

v0 changes are tightly scoped and reversible. Work in this layer must follow the PROCESS rules that gate what is allowed, how changes are reviewed, and how rollback remains possible.
